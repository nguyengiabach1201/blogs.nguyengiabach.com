description: Reason why salt was expensive in ancient time
---

Imagine holding a substance so precious it could buy you freedom or spark wars. It wasn't gold, nor jewels, but something far more fundamental to life: salt. Today, it's ubiquitous and cheap, but rewind history, and you'll find salt was a luxury, a commodity so valuable its worth rivaled precious metals.

# Difficulty in harvesting

Prior to industrialization, it was extremely expensive and labor-intensive to harvest the mass quantities of salt necessary for seasoning and food preservation.

This made salt an extremely valuable commodity. Entire economies were based on salt production and trade. For example, in the Roman Empire, salt was used to pay its legionaries, which is the origin of the word _salary_.

# Being _inflated_

Salt trade was entirely controlled by the goverment in the ancient time. Its production was legally restricted, by doing so, ancient goverments would have the ability to create a _salt shortage_, therefore keep its value high.
