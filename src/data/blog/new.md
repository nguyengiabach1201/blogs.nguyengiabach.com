description: The reasons why the Greek organized the ancient Olympics
---

The modern Olympic Games are the world's leading international sporting events. They are inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which is held in Olympia, Greece every four-year, this period is called an _olympiad_. So why did the ancient Greeks organized these sports events?

# As a way of worship

Like almost all Greek games, the Olympic Games were an essential part of a religious festival. They are dedicated to honor Zeus at Olympia, then was part of Elis, a city state in northwestern Peloponnese.

According to legend, the Games were first organized by Hercules, son of Zeus and Alcmene. But archeology evidence has shown that the first Olympic Games was held in 776 BC, which means all games before 776 BC was founded on myth, not real historical evidence.

# Being banned and forgotten

The Greeks, later the Romans, for thousands of years had met at Olympia to celebrate festivals to honor Zeus and also to ensure that Olympic Games still play an important role. They were still being organized till the 4th century AD. In 393 AD, the Christian emperor Theodosius I forbade the celebration of pagan cults, which included the Games. But the popularity of the Games continue to influence many provinces of the Roman Empire as late as the 6th century AD.
