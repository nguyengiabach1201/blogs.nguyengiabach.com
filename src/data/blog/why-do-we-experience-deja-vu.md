description: The explanation for the phenomenon of déjà vu, why we experience it
---

Ever had that eerie feeling, that fleeting certainty you've lived this exact moment before, down to the smallest detail? It's like a glitch in the matrix of your memory. But is it a trick of the mind, a whisper from a past life, or something far more grounded in the workings of our brain? Let's explore the fascinating puzzle of déjà vu.

# Two types of déjà vu

Déjà vu is often split into _associative_ and _biological_ types. Associative déjà vu, common for most, is triggered by familiar elements in a new situation, linked to forgotten past experiences. Biological déjà vu, rarer and sometimes tied to conditions like epilepsy, involves intense familiarity in novel settings, possibly due to abnormal brain activity.

# Neurological explanations

Neurologically, déjà vu might arise from a processing hiccup in memory circuits, where the brain receives information twice with a slight delay. Another idea involves familiarity signals firing too strongly for a new event.

# Psychological perspectives

Psychologically, unconscious memories could trigger familiarity in new situations with subtle connections to the past. Divided attention might also play a role; a later, focused look at something initially perceived vaguely could feel like a memory.
